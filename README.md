# testrepo
## My testrepo is the Week 5 Lecture Assignment for the class Doing Data Science (MSDS 6306 - 403). My instructions are:
### Go to your testrepo on GitHub.
### Create a “readme” file explaining the repo. The README can be edited as needed.
### The repo should contain a text or screen shot of your data science profile from unit 1. If not, please add and commit the file to your testrepo as described in the previous module.
### The testrepo should also contain files from McGee’s stat6306datascience repo.
### Post the link to your testrepo below.
